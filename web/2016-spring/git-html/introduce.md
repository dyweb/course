# Git Introduce

## What is Git?

The widely used source code management system for software development in the world.

## History

- In 2002, the developers of the Linux kernel use [Bitkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper) to maintain the project, but the Bitkeeper is not good for developing.
- In 2005, the copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols.
- In 2005, Torvalds decided to develop a distributed system to replace the Bitkeeper. So, he create git.

- svn, working-copy collaboration
- git, repo-to-repo collaboration
